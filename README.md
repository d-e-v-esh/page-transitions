# **Next.js Page Transitions with Framer-Motion**

This repository contains a Next.js project where I have implemented smooth page transitions using the **`framer-motion`** library. The primary goal of this project is to showcase a simple and elegant solution for enhancing the user experience by adding engaging page transitions.

## **Implementation Overview**

The main feature of this project is the implementation of the **`_app.tsx`** file. This file contains the custom App component that wraps around the entire Next.js application, allowing us to introduce **`framer-motion`** for page transitions.

To use this implementation in your own projects, simply copy the relevant code from the **`_app.tsx`** file and modify it according to your needs. The code is modular and easy to customize, so you can effortlessly adapt it to fit your project's design and requirements.
